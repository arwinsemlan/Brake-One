## 10/21/2025 - Made a design and started 3d modeling  

I started with thinking of what i want my sim racing Hand/Parking brake to be able to do, what features it should have.

**Features**
- Customizability 
- Feedback


I want that my handbrake is the most customizable that exists. What i want is to be able to put into a program how much the handbrake will resist. I want to be able to say to it to only resist with 0.5 kg or 5 kg and when to lock up, if it only moves 10 degrees or 45. I also want to be able to say to it how the resistance changes for the angle i have pulled it back. I want to be able to says to it to become linearly or even exponentialy harder to pull the stick back. I also want it to give some kind of feedback. I have read that there are some kind of sim racing handbrakes that give some sort of feedback, I also want to achive this. 

I came to think of this after seeing the simucube activepedal and a diy version of it. The simucube activepedal is a brake or a gas pedal that can give different resistance and also give feedback to the sim driver.

This is a picture of the diy simucube activepedal

After seeing the diy simucube activepedal i thought about that the same method could be used with handbrakes to create a new level of sim racing handbrakes. So after that i did some research about what i could use to make this a real thing. I have not come to far with the research and i want to write about it after i have done some more research. And i have begun modeling a simple design for the handbrake.

To make this 3d model i learned how to use onshape. I have done some small things with it and other similar cad programs but this is the first thime i have made something with this many pieces. I have also learn how to use the assembly feature to make this model be able to move and simulate usage. This is something i always wanted to learn and I am happy to finally be able to make moving 3d models.
